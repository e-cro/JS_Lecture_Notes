/*
Git set up and practice

For the folder with the files you want to make the git repository for: in VS Code, right-click on that folder and select Open in Integrated Terminal

git status    //ok to enter this any time, tells you where you are and the status
1) git init       //initializes empty Git repository in this folder

2) git add .  //the . means all files in the current directory
3) git commit -m "Commit message goes here"

repeat 2 & 3 after every change in the file

If you wind up in the text editor for entering "git commit" without making a -m commit message, it will put you into the "VI" text editor to force you to make a commit message. To get out of this:
Esc
:q!
