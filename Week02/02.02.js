/*
Git set up and practice

For the folder with the files you want to make the git repository for: in VS Code, right-click on that folder and select Open in Integrated Terminal

git status    //ok to enter this any time, tells you where you are and the status
1) git init       //initializes empty Git repository in this folder

2) git add .  //the . means all files in the current directory
3) git commit -m "Commit message goes here"

repeat 2 & 3 after every change in the file  (optional different way instead of command line/powershell: click on the Source Control icon on the very left border of the page - should have a number on it indicating uncommitted changes, then click on the plus sign just to the right of the file name, and then click on the checkmark above it and enter the commit message that you would've put between the quotation marks if you were doing git commit -m"dfjadfjladjf")

If you wind up in the text editor for entering "git commit" without making a -m commit message, it will put you into the "VI" text editor to force you to make a commit message. To get out of this:
Esc
:q!
